    <h1>Housing Price Prediction Project</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>This project focuses on predicting the prices of houses based on various features. It involves extensive data analysis, preprocessing, and application of machine learning models to estimate housing prices accurately.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploring and analyzing housing data to understand key trends and patterns.</li>
        <li>Preprocessing and cleaning data to make it suitable for modeling.</li>
        <li>Utilizing various regression models to predict housing prices.</li>
        <li>Comparing different models to determine the most effective approach.</li>
        <li>Extracting insights and identifying factors that significantly affect housing prices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python: Primary programming language for analysis and modeling.</li>
        <li>Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.</li>
        <li>Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data insights and trends.</li>
        <li>Scikit-Learn: For implementing and tuning various regression models.</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and presentation of work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>The dataset includes numerous features like location, area, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant factors. Special attention was given to handling missing values and encoding categorical data.</p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Insights into the correlation between different features and house prices.</li>
        <li>Impact of location, size, and other features on the pricing of houses.</li>
        <li>Identification of features that contribute most to the variance in prices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Modeling and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, were tested. Models were evaluated using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error, and others. Feature importance and model interpretation were also discussed.</p>

    <h2>Future Scope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploring more advanced and robust regression techniques.</li>
        <li>Incorporating additional external factors that might affect prices.</li>
        <li>Developing a web-based application to provide real-time price estimates.</li>
    </ul>
